            <p>his is a plate with one or more false teeth on it. It may be all plastic or a mixture of metal and plastic.
                Both types may have clips (clasps) to help keep the denture in place in your mouth. Depending on where they are,
                some of these clips may show when you smile or open your mouth.Partial dentures replace missing teeth and stay
                in place by attaching to a person's remaining teeth with a metal or acrylic clasp. A removable partial
                denture can replace one or several front or back teeth. This appliance can be used on the top or bottom arch
                of teeth and is an option for patients who want to replace missing teeth while saving as many natural teeth as
                possible. There is a multistep process for getting partial dentures that includes making the natural teeth as
                healthy as possible and taking steps to ensure a proper fit of the final product.</p>

            <h2>The partial denture fabrication process</h2>
            <p>In order to fabricate a partial denture that fits properly and is stable, the patient's natural teeth
                must be restored to a healthy state. After that, the dentist takes impressions that are sent to a
                ab where the denture is made. Once the patient has the final product, the dentist can make adjustments as needed.</p>

            <h2>Restoration of anchor teeth</h2>
            <p>It is generally not recommended to fit partial dentures to teeth that are at risk to be lost due to dental infection or decay.
                Therefore, the patient's remaining natural teeth that will act as anchor teeth for the partial denture must be as healthy
                as possible. The dentist may recommend that all nonrestorable teeth be pulled. Once the teeth that are to be saved are
                identified, any cavities or signs of periodontal disease can be treated.</p>

            <h2>Impressions</h2>
            <p>Once the patient's anchor teeth are stable, impressions can be made for the partial denture.
                The lab then makes a custom-fit denture with teeth in the patient's selected shade and gums that match the patient's natural ones.
                Sometimes there is a preliminary try-in stage before the final product is made to ensure that the framework is fitting as expected. </p>

            <h2>Delivery and adjustments</h2>
            <p>The lab will send the finished denture to the dentist to deliver to the patient. At that appointment, the patient can let the
                dentist know if any spots feel rough or need to be adjusted.</p>

            <p>It may take several days or even weeks for the patient to feel normal wearing the partial denture, and a few adjustments
                may need to be made in the weeks following initial delivery. During this time, the patient should be instructed on how to care for
                the partial denture at home. It should be removed every night and soaked in a denture cleaner and can be brushed wi</p>

            <p>Partial dentures can be a viable option for patients looking to replace missing teeth without going through the expense of having
                multiple implants placed. These removable devices can be made to look natural and match the patient's other teeth, giving the
                patient confidence that may have been lost due to missing teeth.</p>

        <p>For patients considering partial dentures as a restorative option, focusing on caring for the remaining teeth and taking care of the denture
            should be top priority. In this way, patients can have a smile that lasts. </p>
